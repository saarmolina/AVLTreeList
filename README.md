# AVLTreeList: 
This project is a Python implementation of an AVL Tree List, showcasing advanced skills in data structure manipulation and algorithm design. It highlights my understanding of self-balancing binary search trees, particularly AVL trees, and their use in efficiently maintaining sorted data structures. The implementation covers key computer science concepts, including tree rotations, balance factor maintenance, and operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups, all achieving optimal time complexity.

## Complexity Documentation
Each function's worst-case time complexity is documented both in the code and in a separate detailed document. Every effort has been made to achieve the lowest possible time complexity for each function.

## Output
No user output is required.
